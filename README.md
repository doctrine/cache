Cache component extracted from the Doctrine Common project. [Documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-cache/en/current/index.html)

This library is deprecated and will no longer receive bug fixes from the
Doctrine Project. Please use a different cache library, preferably PSR-6 or
PSR-16 instead.
